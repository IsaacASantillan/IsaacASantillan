# Who Am I?

Hi, 

I'm Isaac Alejandro Santillan, a student at UC Berkeley class of 2024. Come check out some of python repositories!

My love for programing began at the ripe age of 14 years old, when I entered the MacOs Utilities terminal in order bypass my parental controls. As a Python language enthusiast, I've built multiple, complex projects from scratch both for fun and for published research. 

Some of my personal favorite projects include rebuilding the popular app games Flappy Bird and Space Invaders using the well loved Python pygame library.
