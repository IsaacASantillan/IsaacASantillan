# Who Am I?

Hi, 
I'm Isaac Santillan, a student at UC Berkeley class of 2024. Come check out some of python repositories!

My love for programing began at the ripe age of 14 years old, when I entered the MacOs Utilities terminal in order bypass my parental controls. As a Python, Scheme, Java and CSS language enthusiast, I've built multiple, complex projects from scratch both for fun and for published research. 

Some of my personal favorite projects include rebuilding the popular app games Flappy Bird and Space Invaders using the well loved Python pygame library. 

My hobby out creating video games from scratch led me to started and teach a successful three-week long python program called Santa Cruz Coding for Kids with a focus on diversity and equity in order to teach local kids how to code their own video games. More than 20 kids signed up and I taught python basics and graphics design. Here is the website I designed for my program: https://isaacsantillan1.wixsite.com/my-site-2

From a professional viewpoint, my more important projects include using the R programing language to decipher and graph correlations between the diet of different mustelid species and their respective bite fore during a summer internship with UCSC. Here is my team's published Journal of Evolutionary Biology article: https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30270461/. 

Wanting to continue my love for biology and coding, I hiked, collaborated, and collected data with licensed arborists the following summer in order to gather research data on the amount of damage done to different tree species in the Big Basin Northern California Wildfire.
